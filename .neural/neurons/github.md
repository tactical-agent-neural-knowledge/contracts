- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the only workflow in the repo. Two jobs: `check` (PRs, main, `v*` tags) and `publish-ts` (pushes only, `needs: check`). Unchanged since the last refresh.
- CI calls `buf` directly from `bufbuild/buf-setup-action@v1`, never `make`. A change to the `Makefile` alone is therefore not exercised by CI — the two must be kept in step by hand.
- The breaking check is the point of the whole file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:31` says a wire break here "would be a production incident in web/mobile/agent-runner, so it is caught at the source". It runs only `if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'`.
- Trap, and the reason the step has three lines instead of one: `actions/checkout` leaves a PR on a detached merge commit with no local `main`, so the step must `git fetch --no-tags origin main:main` before `buf breaking --against ".git#branch=main"` can read it. The same applies locally on a fresh clone.
- `actions/checkout@v4` is pinned to `fetch-depth: 0` purely so that breaking check has history; shallowing it breaks the comparison, not the build.
- The staleness gate is `buf generate` followed by `git diff --exit-code --stat gen/`, failing with `::error::gen/ is stale. Run 'make gen' and commit the result.` Regenerating with a different buf or plugin version than the pins in `buf.gen.yaml` will trip it.
- The Go version is never written in the workflow: `actions/setup-go@v5` takes `go-version-file: go.mod`, so bumping Go means editing `go.mod`.
- The TypeScript check is `npm install --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build` in `gen/ts` on node 24 — a tsc compile of the generated sources, no tests.
- `publish-ts` versions without committing (`npm version --no-git-tag-version`): a `v*` tag publishes `${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}` under dist-tag `latest`, a push to main publishes `0.0.0-canary.${GITHUB_SHA::12}` under `canary`. PRs never publish, because the job is gated on `github.event_name == 'push'`.
- Publishing goes to GitHub Packages (`registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com`, `scope: "@tactical-agent-neural-knowledge"`, `npm publish --access restricted`) authenticated with `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}` — no external npm credential exists or is needed.
- Permissions are least-privilege and deliberate: the workflow declares `contents: read` at the top, and only `publish-ts` adds `packages: write`.
- `concurrency: group: ci-${{ github.ref }}` with `cancel-in-progress: true` — a second push to the same ref kills the first run, including a half-finished publish.

## Verified

`npx --yes @bufbuild/buf lint` and `npx --yes @bufbuild/buf breaking --against '.git#branch=main'` — the two checks this workflow runs that can be reproduced outside Actions; both passed. The workflow itself was not executed.
